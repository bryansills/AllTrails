# AllTrails at lunch
Demo app made while interviewing at AllTrails

## Setup
Run the following command and fill out the `secrets.properties` file with valid values.
```
cp secrets.properties.example secrets.properties
```
This isn't what you should do for a real, production app, but works fine for an interview task.
